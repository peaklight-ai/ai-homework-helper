# Roadmap: Valid - AI Homework Helper

## Overview

This MVP delivers a complete adaptive learning platform in 3 focused sprints over 3 weeks (ending end of February 2026). Sprint 1 builds the teacher experience foundation (class management, exercise upload, bug fixes). Sprint 2 delivers the student experience differentiator (diagnostic assessment, cognitive visibility, student profiles). Buffer week polishes hints/strategies and refines progression logic before handoff.

## Phases

**Phase Numbering:**
- Integer phases (1, 2, 3): Planned milestone work
- Decimal phases (1.1, 1.2): Urgent insertions (marked with INSERTED)

Decimal phases appear between their surrounding integers in numeric order.

- [ ] **Phase 1: Sprint 1 - Teacher Experience** - Bug fixes, class management, exercise upload
- [ ] **Phase 2: Sprint 2 - Student Experience & Analytics** - Diagnostics, profiles, cognitive visibility
- [ ] **Phase 3: Buffer Week - Polish** - Hints/strategies, progression refinement

## Phase Details

### Phase 1: Sprint 1 - Teacher Experience
**Goal**: Teachers can organize students into classes, configure settings, and assign exercises
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements**: BUG-01, BUG-02, CLASS-01, CLASS-02, CLASS-03, SETTINGS-01, HW-01, HW-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Teacher can create a class and bulk import students via CSV upload
  2. Teacher can view students organized by class (not mixed list)
  3. Teacher can configure topic and difficulty level for individual students
  4. Teacher can upload homework and assign exercises to specific students
  5. App does not block interaction after correct answer (bug fixed)
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 01-01: TBD
- [ ] 01-02: TBD
- [ ] 01-03: TBD

### Phase 2: Sprint 2 - Student Experience & Analytics
**Goal**: Students receive diagnostic placement and teachers gain cognitive visibility into how students think
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Requirements**: DIAG-01, DIAG-02, DIAG-03, STUDENT-01, STUDENT-02, STUDENT-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Student automatically receives diagnostic test on first login
  2. Diagnostic results set student's initial difficulty level (no teacher intervention needed)
  3. Teacher receives diagnostic results for visibility
  4. Student can see their targets/objectives set by teacher
  5. Teacher can view student's reasoning patterns (cognitive visibility - how they think, not just right/wrong)
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 02-01: TBD
- [ ] 02-02: TBD
- [ ] 02-03: TBD

### Phase 3: Buffer Week - Polish
**Goal**: Enhance exercise system with hints and refine adaptive progression logic
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Requirements**: SETTINGS-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Teacher can upload hints/strategies linked to specific exercises
  2. Progression logic refined per Yusef's review pack reference
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 03-01: TBD
