# Roadmap: Valid - AI Homework Helper

## Overview

This MVP delivers a complete adaptive learning platform in 3 focused sprints over 3 weeks (ending end of February 2026). Sprint 1 builds the teacher experience foundation (class management, exercise upload, bug fixes). Sprint 2 delivers the student experience differentiator (diagnostic assessment, cognitive visibility, student profiles). Buffer week polishes hints/strategies and refines progression logic before handoff.

## Phases

- [x] **Phase 1: Sprint 1 - Teacher Experience** - Bug fixes, class management, exercise upload
- [x] **Phase 2: Sprint 2 - Student Experience & Analytics** - Diagnostics, profiles, cognitive visibility
- [x] **Phase 3: Buffer Week - Polish** - Hints/strategies, progression refinement

## Phase Details

### Phase 1: Sprint 1 - Teacher Experience ✅
**Goal**: Teachers can organize students into classes, configure settings, and assign exercises
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Success Criteria**:
  1. ✅ Teacher can create a class and bulk import students via CSV upload
  2. ✅ Teacher can view students organized by class (not mixed list)
  3. ✅ Teacher can configure topic and difficulty level for individual students
  4. ✅ Teacher can upload homework and assign exercises to specific students
  5. ✅ App does not block interaction after correct answer (bug fixed)

### Phase 2: Sprint 2 - Student Experience & Analytics ✅
**Goal**: Students receive diagnostic placement and teachers gain cognitive visibility into how students think
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Success Criteria**:
  1. ✅ Student automatically receives diagnostic test on first login
  2. ✅ Diagnostic results set student's initial difficulty level (no teacher intervention needed)
  3. ✅ Teacher receives diagnostic results for visibility
  4. ✅ Student can see their targets/objectives set by teacher
  5. ✅ Teacher can view student's reasoning patterns (cognitive visibility)

### Phase 3: Buffer Week - Polish ✅
**Goal**: Enhance exercise system with hints and refine adaptive progression logic
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Success Criteria**:
  1. ✅ Teacher can upload hints/strategies linked to specific exercises
  2. ✅ Progression logic refined per pedagogy reference
