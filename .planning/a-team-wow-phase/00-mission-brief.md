# Mission Brief: Valid "Wow Factor" Phase

## Overall Objective
Design a new GSD phase for Valid that transforms it from functional MVP to an elegant product that impresses all stakeholders: teachers (efficiency/visibility), schools/admin (ROI/compliance), parents (involvement/progress), and students (engagement/achievement).

## Success Criteria
- Teachers show the product to other teachers unprompted
- Administrators see clear data they can report upward
- Parents feel connected to their child's learning journey
- Students want to use it (not forced to)
- The product feels cohesive and polished, not like a feature dump

## Specialists Involved
1. **Pattern Breaker** - Creative exploration of what "wow" means per stakeholder
2. **Logic Validator** - Rigorous filtering of ideas for real impact vs. gimmicks
3. **Pragmatic Architect** - Structure into buildable GSD phase

## Strategic Context
- MVP is complete but feels functional, not delightful
- Competition in EdTech is fierce; differentiation matters
- Word-of-mouth from impressed stakeholders is the growth engine
- This phase should create "demo moments" - features that make people lean in

## Collaboration Pattern
Sequential Pipeline: Creative → Validation → Architecture

## Expected Flow
1. Pattern Breaker produces divergent ideas organized by stakeholder + cross-cutting "wow" themes
2. Logic Validator filters to high-impact, non-gimmick features with clear reasoning
3. Pragmatic Architect structures into GSD phase with prioritized requirements

## Key Questions to Answer
- What makes a teacher LOVE a tool vs. tolerate it?
- What data would make a principal's report to the board impressive?
- How do parents feel connected without being intrusive?
- What keeps a 7-year-old engaged better than YouTube?

## Current MVP State
- Class management (create, edit, delete classes)
- CSV student import
- Diagnostic placement test (adaptive, sets difficulty)
- Exercise upload with hints & strategies
- Pedagogy-based AI tutoring (guided/scaffold/coach by grade)
- Topic mastery tracking
- Student targets/objectives
- XP/gamification system
