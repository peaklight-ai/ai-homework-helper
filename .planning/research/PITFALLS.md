## Critical Pitfalls

Mistakes that cause rewrites, major issues, or fundamentally undermine the product.

---

### Pitfall 1: Using Built-In Assessments as Ground Truth

**What goes wrong:** EdTech providers create in-house diagnostic tests that measure something different from actual learning outcomes. Children score high on app tests but perform poorly on teacher-administered assessments.

**Why it happens:** Tests are built by developers or generated by AI to match learning content, not validated by educational researchers. Questions may be too easy, ambiguous, or measure pattern recognition rather than specific skills.

**Consequences:**
- False sense of progress for students, parents, and teachers
- Difficulty levels set incorrectly based on misleading diagnostic data
- Loss of trust when app results don't match classroom reality
- Potential over-remediation or under-challenge based on faulty placement

**Warning signs:**
- Students consistently score higher on app tests than on teacher assessments
- Diagnostic results cluster at extremes (most students "at grade level" or "behind")
- Teachers report that app's level recommendations don't match their observations
- No external validation of assessment questions

**Prevention:**
- Align diagnostic questions with validated standards (Common Core, provincial curricula)
- Start with simpler approach: use diagnostic to inform relative difficulty, not absolute grade-level claims
- Collect teacher feedback loop: "Did this initial placement feel right?"
- Consider in-line formative assessment during tutoring rather than single high-stakes diagnostic

**Which phase should address it:** Phase 1 (Diagnostic Test Design)
- Design diagnostic with validated question alignment
- Build feedback mechanism for teachers to adjust placements

### Pitfall 2: Over-Remediation from Coarse Diagnostics

**What goes wrong:** Diagnostic test identifies "doesn't know fractions" when student actually knows most fraction concepts but needs minor remediation on one sub-skill. Student gets placed in extensive remediation that wastes time and causes frustration.

**Why it happens:** Standardized assessments force false dichotomies (knows it / doesn't know it) because the number of questions needed to pinpoint exact skill gaps is untenable. A student might know "something" about a topic and need just a small amount of remediation.

**Consequences:**
- Students bored by redundant instruction on already-mastered content
- Teacher time wasted reviewing unnecessary remediation recommendations
- Disadvantaged students placed further behind than necessary, entrenching achievement gaps
- Loss of engagement as students feel the app doesn't understand them

**Warning signs:**
- Students complaining work is "too easy" shortly after diagnostic
- High skip/abandon rates on recommended remediation content
- Teachers frequently overriding app's level recommendations
- Diagnostic covers topics at binary (yes/no) granularity

**Prevention:**
- Design diagnostic with multiple questions per sub-skill to distinguish partial from complete mastery
- Implement "just-in-time" learning: start students on grade-level content and diagnose gaps inline
- Allow teachers to easily override and adjust difficulty settings
- Track when students demonstrate mastery quickly and auto-adjust upward

**Which phase should address it:** Phase 1 (Diagnostic Design) + Phase 2 (Adaptive Difficulty)
- Phase 1: Build diagnostic with granular sub-skill coverage
- Phase 2: Implement dynamic adjustment based on tutoring session performance

### Pitfall 3: Feedback Loop Disasters in Adaptive Systems

**What goes wrong:** When adaptive algorithms misinterpret student behavior (e.g., treating rapid guessing as low ability), they assign easier content. Students get bored, guess more rapidly, algorithm interprets this as struggle, assigns even easier content. The feedback loop spirals.

**Why it happens:** Algorithms optimize for narrow signals (correct/incorrect) without detecting engagement patterns like rapid guessing, random clicking, or frustration behaviors. These feedback loops are often hidden and interact in unexpected ways.

**Consequences:**
- Students stuck at inappropriately low difficulty for extended periods
- Near-impossible to reach "mastery" because rapid guessing attempts comprise half of all attempts
- Student frustration and disengagement
- Inaccurate student profiles that persist

**Warning signs:**
- Average time-per-question is suspiciously low (rapid guessing)
- Student progress stalls despite continued usage
- Answer patterns show random distribution (25% correct on 4-option multiple choice)
- Students report work is "too easy" while algorithm keeps them at same level

**Prevention:**
- Track response time as signal; flag suspiciously fast answers
- Implement "guess detection" (random answer patterns, no pause before response)
- Allow manual teacher override of difficulty levels
- Add circuit breakers: if student hasn't progressed in X sessions, flag for teacher review
- Display engagement metrics alongside accuracy in teacher dashboard

**Which phase should address it:** Phase 2 (Adaptive Difficulty Logic)
- Build response-time tracking from day one
- Implement guess detection heuristics
- Add teacher override controls

---

### Pitfall 4: Ceiling and Floor Effects Hide True Ability

**What goes wrong:** Diagnostic test designed for "grade level" difficulty means advanced students answer everything correctly (ceiling) and struggling students answer everything incorrectly (floor). Neither gets useful diagnostic information.

**Why it happens:** Test designers select questions at middle of grade level difficulty. Static fixed-form tests can't adapt to students outside the expected range.

**Consequences:**
- Above-grade-level students not challenged, don't make progress they could
- Below-grade-level students demoralized by answering everything wrong
- No useful information for teachers about actual ability levels
- Value-added analysis becomes meaningless (can't measure growth at extremes)

**Warning signs:**
- Diagnostic results show bimodal distribution (perfect scores and near-zero scores)
- Teachers report diagnostic "missed" that a student is advanced or struggling
- Students finish diagnostic very quickly (ceiling) or give up (floor)
- Progress tracking shows no change over time for top/bottom performers

**Prevention:**
- Implement adaptive diagnostic that adjusts difficulty based on responses
- Include questions spanning 2 grades above and below target
- Start with medium difficulty, branch up/down based on early responses
- For primary grades (1-6), ensure questions exist down to pre-K and up to grade 8
- Set clear stopping rules so students don't face endless questions

**Which phase should address it:** Phase 1 (Diagnostic Test)
- Design adaptive diagnostic algorithm from the start
- Ensure question bank covers wide difficulty range

---

### Pitfall 5: COPPA/FERPA Compliance Failures

**What goes wrong:** Collecting data on children under 13 without proper parental consent or school authorization. Storing unnecessary PII. Sharing data with third parties. Not having data deletion protocols.

**Why it happens:** 2025 COPPA amendments significantly tightened requirements. EdTech companies often overlook that COPPA applies to them when serving K-12 students. Default behavior shifted from opt-out to opt-in consent.

**Consequences:**
- FTC enforcement actions and fines
- Loss of school contracts
- Reputational damage
- Legal liability
- Data breaches affecting minors

**Warning signs:**
- No parental consent flow for students under 13
- Collecting more data than needed for educational purpose
- No data retention/deletion policy
- Third-party analytics or advertising without explicit consent
- No security program documentation

**Prevention:**
- Implement minimal data collection (only what's needed for education)
- Build parental consent workflow or rely on school authorization under FERPA
- Create formal data retention schedule with automatic deletion
- Document security program formally
- No advertising-based data collection for children
- Review contracts with schools to include FERPA requirements

**Which phase should address it:** Phase 1 (Foundation) - address before scaling
- Audit current data collection in Supabase schema
- Implement data minimization
- Add consent tracking if needed
- Document retention policy

## Moderate Pitfalls

Mistakes that cause delays, technical debt, or reduced effectiveness.

---

### Pitfall 6: Teacher Dashboard Information Overload

**What goes wrong:** Dashboard shows every metric available (XP, accuracy, streaks, time spent, questions attempted, topics covered, etc.) but teachers can't extract actionable insights. They either ignore the dashboard or spend too long trying to interpret it.

**Why it happens:** Developers add metrics because they're available, not because teachers need them. Dashboard designed without teacher input. No consideration of teachers' varying data literacy levels.

**Consequences:**
- Teachers don't use the analytics features
- Teachers misinterpret data and make wrong instructional decisions
- Cognitive overload leads to frustration
- No return on investment for analytics development

**Warning signs:**
- Low dashboard engagement metrics
- Teachers asking "what does this mean?"
- Requests for "just tell me who needs help"
- Teachers exporting data to Excel to create their own summaries

**Prevention:**
- Design dashboards with teachers as co-designers
- Lead with actionable summaries ("3 students need attention")
- Progressive disclosure: summary first, details on demand
- Provide interpretation guidance ("This score means...")
- Test with teachers of varying data literacy levels
- Single-page dashboard for low-VL teachers performs better than multi-page

**Which phase should address it:** Phase 3 (Teacher Analytics)
- Start with minimal viable dashboard
- Interview teachers about what decisions they need to make
- Design for least data-literate user

---

### Pitfall 7: Socratic AI Giving Up Too Early or Too Late

**What goes wrong:** AI either gives direct answers too quickly (abandoning Socratic method when student struggles) or keeps asking probing questions indefinitely (frustrating students who genuinely need help).

**Why it happens:** Balancing challenge with support is hard. AI can't read student emotional state. No clear escalation protocol for when Socratic approach isn't working.

**Consequences:**
- Students learn to "game" the system by appearing stuck
- Students disengage when help feels too far away
- Socratic method gets bad reputation ("the app that never helps")
- Learning outcomes suffer in both directions

**Warning signs:**
- Students expressing frustration ("just tell me!")
- Very long conversation threads without resolution
- Students abandoning problems mid-conversation
- Teachers reporting students "hate" the AI helper

**Prevention:**
- Implement graduated assistance: start Socratic, escalate to hints, then partial solutions
- Track turn count and frustration signals (repeated wrong answers, long pauses)
- Allow student to request "more help" to skip Socratic levels
- Set maximum Socratic turns before escalating
- Give AI motivational persona with positive reinforcement

**Which phase should address it:** Already exists in current app but should be reviewed in Phase 2
- Review current Socratic prompts in `/lib/gemini.ts`
- Add escalation logic based on turn count
- Add student "help me more" button

### Pitfall 8: Static Student Profiles That Don't Update

**What goes wrong:** Initial diagnostic creates a profile that never changes. Student grows or regresses but app keeps treating them the same way. Strengths/weaknesses become stale labels.

**Why it happens:** Dynamic profiling is technically complex. Forgetting curves and learning curves need to be modeled. Most systems only track what students "did" not how their abilities evolved.

**Consequences:**
- Students feel pigeonholed
- Recommendations become irrelevant over time
- Teachers don't trust the profile data
- No way to celebrate growth or catch regression

**Warning signs:**
- Student profile shows same strengths/weaknesses months later
- Teacher feedback contradicts profile data
- Students complaining about repetitive content in their "weak" areas
- No mechanism to trigger profile updates

**Prevention:**
- Build profiles that decay over time (confidence decreases without reinforcement)
- Update profile after every tutoring session, not just diagnostic
- Show teachers "profile freshness" - how recently was this data collected?
- Implement both "learning curve" (gains from practice) and "forgetting curve" (decay without practice)
- Allow teachers to manually update profile based on classroom observations

**Which phase should address it:** Phase 2 (Strengths/Weaknesses Tracking)
- Design profile schema with timestamp per skill
- Implement decay function for confidence scores
- Update on every interaction, not just tests

---

### Pitfall 9: Gamification Undermining Learning Goals

**What goes wrong:** XP points and badges become the goal rather than learning. Students game the system (rapid-fire easy questions for XP) rather than engaging with challenging material. Competition causes stress.

**Why it happens:** Extrinsic rewards are easy to implement and show immediate engagement boost. Intrinsic motivation is harder to measure. Product metrics (time in app, questions answered) incentivize gamification.

**Consequences:**
- Students optimize for XP, not understanding
- Competitive students stress out, non-competitive students disengage
- Learning outcomes don't improve despite "engagement"
- Teachers distrust XP as progress metric

**Warning signs:**
- Students choosing easiest possible problems to maximize XP
- Complaints about other students' XP being "unfair"
- High engagement metrics but flat learning outcomes
- Students only using app when there's a reward

**Prevention:**
- Award XP for mastery, not just completion
- Weight XP by difficulty (harder = more XP)
- Don't show leaderboards to students (or make them opt-in)
- Track learning outcomes separately from engagement metrics
- Provide non-competitive progress visualizations (personal growth, not ranking)
- Don't overuse gamification - it should enhance, not dominate

**Which phase should address it:** Current app already has XP - review in Phase 2
- Audit XP award logic
- Consider difficulty multiplier for XP
- Ensure teacher dashboard shows learning metrics, not just XP

### Pitfall 10: Curriculum Misalignment

**What goes wrong:** App's problem set and difficulty progression doesn't match what teachers are teaching in class. Students practice content they haven't been introduced to or that isn't in the curriculum.

**Why it happens:** App developers use generic math standards rather than specific curricula. Teachers in different schools/regions follow different sequences. No mechanism for teachers to align app to their teaching plan.

**Consequences:**
- Students confused by unfamiliar concepts
- Teachers can't use app to reinforce classroom lessons
- App becomes "extra" work rather than integrated tool
- Reduced effectiveness when content is isolated from instruction

**Warning signs:**
- Teachers asking "can I turn off [topic]?"
- Students encountering topics they haven't learned yet
- App assignments don't correlate with unit tests
- Teachers using app only for review, not during instruction

**Prevention:**
- Allow teachers to select which topics/units are active
- Provide curriculum alignment guides (Common Core, provincial standards)
- Let teachers sequence topics to match their teaching order
- Build topic dependencies so app doesn't assign content requiring prerequisites students haven't covered

**Which phase should address it:** Phase 1 (Teacher Settings) - already have topic selection
- Extend existing topic selection in student_settings
- Add topic sequencing/prerequisites
- Consider unit/chapter organization

## Minor Pitfalls

Mistakes that cause annoyance but are fixable without major rework.

---

### Pitfall 11: One-Size-Fits-All Diagnostic Administration

**What goes wrong:** Same diagnostic format for grade 1 (6-year-olds) and grade 6 (12-year-olds). Younger students can't read instructions, get frustrated with too many questions, or don't understand interface.

**Why it happens:** Diagnostic built as single experience to reduce development time. Adult assumptions about attention span and reading ability.

**Consequences:**
- Inaccurate results for youngest students
- Frustration and negative first impression
- Teachers having to sit with each young student

**Prevention:**
- Age-appropriate diagnostic length (shorter for younger grades)
- Read-aloud support for K-2 students
- Visual/interactive question formats for early grades
- Progress indicator so students know how much is left

**Which phase should address it:** Phase 1 (Diagnostic)
- Design grade-band variants (K-2, 3-4, 5-6)
- Shorter diagnostic for younger students

---

### Pitfall 12: Ignoring Accessibility

**What goes wrong:** Students with learning differences, visual impairments, or motor difficulties can't use the app effectively. No consideration for screen readers, color contrast, or alternative input methods.

**Consequences:**
- Exclusion of students who need help most
- Legal compliance issues (ADA/Section 508)
- Inaccurate assessment of students with disabilities

**Prevention:**
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance as baseline
- Test with screen readers
- Sufficient color contrast
- Keyboard navigation support
- Consider dyslexia-friendly fonts as option

**Which phase should address it:** All phases - ongoing concern
- Audit current app for basic accessibility
- Add to acceptance criteria for new features

---

### Pitfall 13: No Offline Support

**What goes wrong:** Students in schools with unreliable internet lose progress, can't access tutoring during connectivity gaps. App assumes constant connectivity.

**Why it happens:** Real-time sync with Supabase is simpler than offline-first architecture. Mobile support not prioritized.

**Consequences:**
- Lost work and frustration
- Inequity for students in under-resourced schools
- Teachers can't rely on app for homework if students have no home internet

**Prevention:**
- Queue interactions locally when offline
- Sync when connectivity returns
- Show clear offline indicator
- Consider progressive web app approach

**Which phase should address it:** Future phase - not MVP critical
- Note for post-MVP roadmap
- Current Dexie.js setup provides foundation for offline

## Phase-Specific Warnings

| Phase Topic | Likely Pitfall | Mitigation |
|-------------|---------------|------------|
| Diagnostic Test | Ceiling/floor effects, over-remediation | Adaptive algorithm, multiple questions per sub-skill |
| Initial Level Setting | False precision from limited data | Start conservative, adjust based on tutoring |
| Strengths/Weaknesses | Static profiles, stale data | Decay functions, continuous updates |
| Adaptive Difficulty | Feedback loop disasters | Response time tracking, guess detection |
| Teacher Analytics | Information overload | Progressive disclosure, actionable summaries |
| Teacher Settings | Curriculum misalignment | Topic sequencing, prerequisites |
| Class Management | Privacy compliance | Data minimization, consent workflows |
| Socratic AI | Wrong balance of help | Graduated assistance, escalation rules |
| Gamification (existing) | XP gaming | Mastery-based rewards, difficulty weighting |

---

## Project-Specific Concerns

Based on the existing codebase and PROJECT.md, these deserve special attention:

### Known Issue: App Blocks After Correct Answer
- Listed as bug in PROJECT.md
- Fix before implementing new features
- Could confuse diagnostic data if students can't continue

### Dual Data Storage (Dexie + Supabase)
- Technical debt creates risk for analytics
- May cause inconsistent profile data
- Consolidate before building complex analytics

### Current Difficulty System
- `difficulty_level: 1-5` per student exists
- No per-topic difficulty
- May need schema evolution for granular tracking

### 30+ Sample Problems
- Not enough for adaptive system
- Need question bank expansion before adaptive difficulty makes sense
- Consider external question banks or AI-generated questions
