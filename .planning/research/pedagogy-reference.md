# Math Thinking Stages by Grade Level

Reference for adaptive AI tutoring behavior.

| Grade | Age | Type of Math Thinking | Adult/AI Role |
|-------|-----|----------------------|---------------|
| Preschool | 3-5 | Quantity & patterns | Play and model |
| Grade 1 | 6-7 | Concrete story problems | Solve together (VERY guided) |
| Grade 2 | 7-8 | One-step problems | Teach steps and language |
| Grade 3 | 8-9 | Multi-step strategies | Model and scaffold |
| Grades 4-5 | 9-11 | Independent reasoning | Coach and extend |

## Implementation Notes

The AI tutor should adapt its Socratic approach based on grade:

- **Grades 1-2**: Very guided, solve together, focus on language/steps
- **Grade 3**: Model strategies, scaffold problem-solving
- **Grades 4-5**: Coach toward independence, extend thinking

This affects:
1. Diagnostic test design (DIAG-01, DIAG-02)
2. AI prompt system (how guided vs independent)
3. Difficulty progression logic
